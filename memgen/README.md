# Memgen
Memgen is a small Java module that creates test memory images for the ECE 552 project. It takes one argument, the number of random address lines to produce, and it outputs to standard output. First the project must be built:
```
javac Memgen.java
```
And then it can be ran assuming it is in the working directory:
```
java Memgen (#of lines) 
```
